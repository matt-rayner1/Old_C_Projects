# Yammouth
A niche, tense and super fun card game with mysterious origins...
I created a hacky bit of code whilst on holiday, so that I could play the game with some friends and keep track without having to do our own maths or writing!

# Rules
Yammouth is a very niche, almost extinct card game. I do not know its true origin.
The rules are complex, but this is by far the most fun, tense, interesting card game I have ever played!

### GOAL: 
Be the last person still in the game. You are out if you have over 100 points.

### CARD SCORING:
The game is point based. Each card has a corresponding number of points:

Ace = 1 point ----> King = 13 points.

Joker = 0 points.

(so a Jack is 11 points, Queen is 12 points. Number cards are worth that amount of points)

(The aim of each round is to reduce the point score of your hand as low as possible (5 or less))

(Lower value cards = better!)
    
### DECK SETUP:
The yammouth deck is best played with roughly 6-8 aces, 4-6 2s, 4-5 3s, etc.

It is also advised to put 2 or 3 jokers in the deck.

It is better to have slightly more lower value cards (in general).

### ROUND SETUP:
The deck is shuffled at the start of each round, before dealing cards.
1) Each player starts with 5 cards.
2) The rest of the cards are placed face down on the table. The top card of this deck is turned face up, and placed next to the deck.
3) Play begins from the winner of the last round (or the dealer if 1st round).

### ROUND PROGRESSION:
1) Each player takes turns (moving clockwise round the table) to place a card (or cards... see SPECIAL RULES),
then pick up a card from the table.
[NOTE: A CARD MUST FIRST BE PLACED DOWN BEFORE PICKING UP A CARD]

2) PLACING PHASE: The player can place down any card, but must do so 'face up' and on top of the last played card (also face up).

3) PICKUP PHASE:   The player can then choose to take the card underneath the card they put down (i.e. from the face up pile),
OR
the player can choose to take a card from the face down deck pile.

4) Play continues until 1 (or more) players has 5 POINTS OR UNDER in their hand at the start of their turn.
>At this point, the player can choose to end the round by calling "YAMMOUTH!".

>OR

>The player can choose NOT to call "YAMMOUTH!", and let play continue.
The player who wins the round gets 0 points, whilst everyone else gets points equal to their hand.

5) Once "YAMMOUTH!" is called, all players must show their hands for score tallying.
>IF: 1 or more players has THE SAME, or LESS points in their hand than the person who ended the round, they can choose
to say "ADDATH!". This causes the person saying "ADDATH!" to instead win the round (recieving 0 points).
The person who initially called "YAMMOUTH!" now recieves 35 points instead.

>This can happen multiple times: E.g: If you have less points than the person calling "ADDATH!", they ALSO recieve 35 points,
and you win the round instead.

>Progression of words to use: YAMMOUTH > ADDATH > SCANZATH > ???? (make your own?)

### SCORING:
After each round, the score is tallied for each player. Score is cumulative throughout rounds.

1) If a player reaches OVER 100, they are GONZED (out) of the match completely.
2) If a player lands on a multiple of 25 (i.e. 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 etc.), their score is reduced by 25 points. (yes, if they win after this, they can go down again
all the way to 0!)
3) If a player has won 10 rounds in a row, their score is reset to 0.
4) If a player has won 10 rounds in a row AND they have been on 0 for these 10 rounds, their score is set to -100. (this is the only way to go below 0 points)
5) -100 is the absolute lowest score possible. (If you win on -100, you stay there).

The last player remaining is the winner!


### SPECIAL RULES:
1) If a player has 2 or more cards of the same value (e.g. 3x kings), they can play all those cards during their card-placing phase.
2) If a player picks up a copy of a card they just placed down (i.e. player places a 5, then picks up a 5), they can 'slam' that card on the face up deck PROVIDED the next player hasn't already placed their card. If the next player manages to place their card first, then the 'slamming' player must pick back up their card.
3) If a player picks up a card that causes their TOTAL HAND to be equal to the card they placed, they can slam in the same way as above.
(E.G: player places a 5, and now only has a 2 in their hand, if they pick up a 3 they get to slam their whole hand)
Note: if a player places a pair down, they can choose to slam the sum of either both the cards or the top card only. (if a player places 2x 5s, they can
choose to slam 5 or 10 if their whole deck equals these values)
4) If a player has a 'run' in the same suite (i.e. 5,6,7 of clubs), they can play this in the same way as in rule 'i)'

### STRATEGIC TIPS:
1)  Always try to lower your hand score. As a general rule, place your highest value cards first.
2)  Aim for pairs to put down if they are present. This reduces the amount of cards you are holding, thus reducing the maximum value you can hold.
(This is one of the only times I will personally pick up a card with a higher value than I am placing.)
3)  Be on the lookout for cards to slam. If you place a 5, train yourself to slam a 5 IMMEDIATELY if you pick one up. Again, this will lower your score further.
4)  Be careful about calling "YAMMOUTH" if the round has been going on a long time. You risk someone having a lower score than you and giving you 35 points!
5)  You can tactically choose to a) not "ADDATH!" someone, or b) not call "YAMMOUTH!", or c) not aim for <5 cards IF the score you get at the end of the round 
will put you on a multiple of 25. 
(EG: you have a score of 18. The round is running quite late, but you havent had luck getting your cards <5. You can choose instead to aim for a round score of 7
to put you on 25, thus setting you to 0 for the next round!)
